## Arrays Resources

To brush up on arrays, check out the resources below.

1. _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Bhargava is a must-read if you’re prepping for interviews. It is not language specific. Check out [Chapter 2, Selection Sort](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-2/)
2. Recommended chapters from Allen B. Downey’s free computer science textbooks.
    * _Think Data Structures_ is a general text about data structures that is not language specific. Check out [Chapter 2, “Analysis of Algorithms”](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast003.html) and [Chapter 3, “ArrayList”](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast004.html)
    * _Think Python_ is a successor to “How To Think Like A Computer Scientist,” specific to Python. If you’d like to think about arrays in Python, check out [Chapter 10, “Lists”](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2011.html)
    * _Think Java_ is the Java version. If you’d like the Java perspective, check out [Chapter 8, “Arrays”](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6009.html)
3. _Harvard CS50 Lectures, 2019_ is a great place to start learning. The demonstration language is C, but you don’t need to know C to follow along. If you expand the bar just below the video window, where it has the picture of the cat for CS50, you can see links to specific timestamps.

## Strings Resources
Strings are a fundamental data-type. Knowing the string manipulation techniques available in your language will serve you well during whiteboarding interviews. Here are a list of patterns you can practice and memorize in your language:
* Iterating through characters in a string, with and without keeping track of the index
* Slicing strings given a start and an end index 
* Finding the index of a target character
* Getting all possible substrings of certain length 
* Getting all possible sets of pairs and triples
* Getting the counts of each character in a string 
* How to make a function case-sensitive and case-insensitive  

The more quickly you can memorize patterns for string manipulation, the more capacity you will have for problem solving!  

### Other patterns and techniques
* Checking for balanced parentheses
